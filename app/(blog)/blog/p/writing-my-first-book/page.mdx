# Writing my first UX book

One of my 2023 to-do lists is writing a book related to my expertise. I then decided to write a book on User Experience, with the title **Practical UX for Developer**.

This book contains my opinions on what should be good UX and also a lot of UX examples from sites that I frequently use.

Throughout the year, I try to update the book whenever I have a new idea or encounter a use case that I haven't covered yet.

I can promise you this book's contents will totally blow you away with a lot of practical UX examples and not just theories.

- Proofread
- Grammar

- Live examples
