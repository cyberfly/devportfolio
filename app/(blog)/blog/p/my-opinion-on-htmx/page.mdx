# My opinion on HTMX

So I have been using HTMX for the last 2 years. On this post, I would like to share my experience and opinion regarding HTMX.

## Backend Developer wet dream

First, lets see why HTMX become so popular with Backend Developer

- Backend Developer hates Javascript and more productive with traditional server side rendering
- HTMX comes with the premise of ZERO JAVASCRIPT, they get to ditch Javascript and use what they love - server side rendering

## The problem

Reactive UI without writing Javascript is super cool, but it can go out of hand very fast. Soon you will see code that doing round trip to API, just to show and hide div. Compare to javascript show and hide, it is very slow!

## More problem

Soon enough when building more complex features, developer will realize they still need to write Javascript.

## Backend code grow bigger

Then after some times, state management will be grow exponentially at backend. Basically HTMX just change the responsibility of managing state from Front End, now it goes to Backend.

## Full Stack developer dilemma

- Full Stack developer dont have any problem writing Javascript
- Full Stack developer are productive in Javascript
- Full Stack developer also productive with server side rendering

### When is the right time to use Javascript?

- Do I use HTMX? Do I just write Javascript?

### Taking the Middleground approach

I have comes to conclusion to use this strategy:

- When there is a need for AJAX call, use HTMX
- When there is simple DOM manipulation, just use Javascript.

By following the strategies above, code can be more maintainable.
