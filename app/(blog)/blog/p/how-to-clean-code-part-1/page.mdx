# How to write Clean Code - Part 1 

In this post, I will share with you some useful tips on how to write clean code. We will use Javascript as examples since it is the most widely used programming language and easy to understand.

### Initial code

This is the initial code before you start updating it.

```
function getPost(post_id) {

  const category = 'car';
  const featured_image_url = null;

  const post = {
    title: 'dummy title',
    body: 'dummy body',
    category: category,
    featured_image_url: featured_image_url,
  };

  return post;
}
```

### Requirements

1. Based on the post category as a keyword, search for an image from the Pexels API.
2. Use the image URL as the value for `featured_image_url`.

### Updated code - V1

Let's say, for the first iteration, you write something like this, by separating the Pexels API codes into a dedicated function.

```
function getPost(post_id) {

  const category = 'car';
  const featured_image_url = getFeaturedImageUrl(category);

  const post = {
    title: 'dummy title',
    body: 'dummy body',
    category: category,
    featured_image_url: featured_image_url,
  };

  return post;

}

function getFeaturedImageUrl(keyword) {
  const apiKey = 'PEXELS_API_KEY';
  const apiUrl = `https://api.pexels.com/v1/search?query=${encodeURIComponent(keyword)}&per_page=10`;

  const featured_image = fetch(apiUrl, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': apiKey,
      }
    })
    .then(response => {

      const response_data = response.json();

      const first_image = response_data.photos[0];

      return first_image;
    })

  // return image url
  return featured_image.src.medium;
}


```

### Problems

1. The function `getFeaturedImageUrl()` has too much responsibility; it needs to fetch images from the API, and it also has logic on how to return the image URL. To achieve clean code, you should try to reduce the responsibility of any function or class.

2. Since `getFeaturedImageUrl()` only returns a single image URL, it cannot be reused when there is a requirement to get an array of images in other functions.

### Updated code - V2

Let's refactor the code to solve the problems above.

```

function getFeaturedImageUrl(keyword) {

  const keyword_images = getPexelImages(keyword);

  const first_image = keyword_images[0];
 
  return first_image.src.medium;
}

function getPexelImages(keyword) {
  const apiKey = 'PEXELS_API_KEY';
  const apiUrl = `https://api.pexels.com/v1/search?query=${encodeURIComponent(keyword)}&per_page=10`;

  const keyword_images = fetch(apiUrl, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': apiKey,
      }
    })
    .then(response => {

      const response_data = response.json();

      return response_data.photos;
    })

  return keyword_images;
}
```
### Explanation

1. `getFeaturedImageUrl()` now only has a single responsibility - how to return the image URL.

2. `getPexelImages(keyword)` now only has a single responsibility - how to return Pexels images.

3. If others need an array of images, they can just call the `getPexelImages(keyword)` function.

### New Requirements

Your manager then comes with new requirements:

1. The featured image must be hosted on S3.

### Updated code - V3

By following the same concept, we just need to add a new function called `getS3Image(image)`, and let getFeatureImageUrl() utilize it.

```
function getFeaturedImageUrl(keyword) {

  const keyword_images = getPexelImages(keyword);

  const first_image = keyword_images[0];

  const image_s3 = getS3Image(first_image);
 
  return image_s3.url;
}

function getPexelImages(keyword) {
}

function getS3Image(image) {
  // do something to upload into S3
  // return S3 image object
}
```

### Single Responsibility

Let's summarize the responsibility for each function:

| Function            | Responsibility         | Responsibility Count |
|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| getPost             | Getting the post, with the image handling delegated to getFeaturedImageUrl()       | 1                    |
| getFeaturedImageUrl | Returning the image URL       | 1                    |
| getPexelImages      | Returning Pexels images | 1                    |
| getS3Image          | Getting the S3 image | 1                    |


### Conclusion

1. Try to give less responsibility to a function or class. The less, the better!

2. You should notice by now that `getPost()` only changed once because all the image-related codes were handled by `getFeaturedImageUrl()`. Awesome!

3. The examples in this post, of course, can still be optimized, but for this tutorial, this is enough to give you the idea on how to improve your code.
