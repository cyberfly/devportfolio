# Vega Service Platform

Interesting project at Nazrol Tech Sdn Bhd where I lead the development of SPA based app using Angular 6 and Laravel API.

For this project, my focus is 70% backend and the rest is 30% front end.

## Background

Client is a government agency where they have multiple vendors for multiple projects. One of their pain points is they need to login to different applications to get datas, and there is no unified way to do that.

Vega Service Platform try to solve this, by providing a powerful UI where user can add their projects API and create custom View using the API data.

## Microservice

Since the client data is scattered throughout multiple places, we use micro services to connect all the data together, and presented in one unified UI with Angular 6.

## Single Sign On with oAuth

I choose Laravel Passport to implement oAuth for project SSO.
