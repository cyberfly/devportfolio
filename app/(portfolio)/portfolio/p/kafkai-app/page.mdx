# Kafkai - AI Content Writer

Kafkai is a Powerful and Easy To Use AI Content Writer that can produce SEO Optimized Articles easily. 

Kafkai is our main focus at LaLoka Labs Co and I consider as my baby.

## Kafkai App

The application part is build on NextJS and TailwindCSS.

### Background

The original project was written on ElmJS. When I took over of the project, I study the codebase and propose that we should re-engineer the codebase.

Reasons:

- Very few resources and tutorials regarding ElmJS
- No ElmJS expert in our team and circles
- Codebase is too hard to maintain, even when making the simplest changes

After getting the green light, I then started the development.

Finally after 3 months, the app was successfully re-engineer with NextJS and release to production on 2021.

### Re-engineer the App from ElmJS to NextJS

- I need to made sure the new Front End can work properly without the need to update the API
- I also took the chance to improve the UI and UX
- Make sure deployment of new web app didnt effected active user

## New Milestone

Last year on August 2023, I researched and presented my idea for Kafkai new milestone. 

I then lead the development of the new milestone and successfully launch it on October 2023.

More details of the new feature can be found here https://kafkai.com/en/blog/introducing-the-next-generation-of-kafkai-the-advance-mode/

I am proud of what I have achieved for the milestone:

- Manage the feature requirements
- Manage designer and developers
- Fine tune UX
- Set the standard for the AI output
- Build the Keyword Research feature - Front End and Back End!
- And finally implement the new Front End
