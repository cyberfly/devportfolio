# Kafkai - AI Content Writer

Kafkai is an AI Content Writer that produced SEO Optimized Articles easily. 

Kafkai is our main focus at LaLoka Labs Co.

## Kafkai App

The application part is build on NextJS and TailwindCSS.

### Background

The original project was written on ElmJS. When I took over of the project, I study the codebase and propose that we should re-engineer the codebase.

Reasons:

- Very less resource and tutorials regarding ElmJS
- No ElmJS expert in our team and circles
- Codebase is too hard to maintain, even when making the simplest changes

After getting the green light, I then started the development.

Finally after 3 months, the app was successfully re-engineer with NextJS.

### Re-engineer the App from ElmJS to NextJS

- I need to made sure the new Front End can work properly without the need to update the API
- I also took the chance to improve the UI and UX
- Make sure deployment of new web app didnt effected active user
