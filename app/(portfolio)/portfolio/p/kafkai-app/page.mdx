# Kafkai Web App - AI Content Writer

The application part is build on NextJS and TailwindCSS.

## Background

The original project was written on ElmJS. When I took over, I study the codebase and propose that we should re-engineer the codebase.

Reasons:

- Very less resource and tutorials regarding ElmJS
- No ElmJS expert in our team and circles
- Codebased is too hard to maintain, even when making the simplest changes

After getting the green light, I then started the development.

Finally after 3 months, the app was successfully re-enginner with NextJS.

## What I have done

- Single handedly re-engineer the app from ElmJs to NextJS 
- Improve the UI
- Improve the UX
- Make sure deployment of new web app didnt effected active user
