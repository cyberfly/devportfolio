# Kafkai - AI Content Writer

Kafkai is a Powerful and Easy To Use AI Content Writer that can produce SEO Optimized Articles easily.

Kafkai is our main focus at LaLoka Labs Co and I also consider it as my baby.

## Kafkai App

Kafkai app is build on NextJS and TailwindCSS.

### Background

The original project was written on ElmJS. When I took over the project, I studied the codebase and proposed that we should re-engineer the codebase.

Reasons:

- Very few resources and tutorials regarding ElmJS
- No ElmJS expert in our team and circles
- Codebase is too hard to maintain, even when making the simplest changes

After getting the green light, I then started the development.

Finally, after 3 months, the app was successfully re-engineered with NextJS and released to production in 2021.

### Re-engineer the App from ElmJS to NextJS

- I need to make sure the new Front End can work properly without the need to update the API
- I also took the chance to improve the UI and UX
- Make sure the deployment of the new web app didn't affect the active user

## New Milestone

**Understanding Customer Pain Points**

Last year in August 2023, I researched and presented my idea for Kafkai's new milestone. 

Here are some summaries of the customer pain points that I have identified:

1. Long Tail Keywords or Low Difficulty Keywords are required to write SEO Optimized articles that can be rank
2. Keyword research is hard and good keyword research tools will cost USD99 per month
3. High learning curve to choose which keywords to use

**My proposed solutions:**

1. Allow user to input multiple keywords to generate the article
2. Add a Powerful Keyword Research feature inside the Generate page
3. Make the keyword research as easy as possible

**Implementing the ideas**

I then led the development of the new milestone and successfully launched the new version in October 2023.

Kafkai users now can easily find long tail keywords that are good for SEO, and instantly generate SEO Optimized articles based on the selected keywords.

More details of the new features can be found here https://kafkai.com/en/blog/introducing-the-next-generation-of-kafkai-the-advance-mode/

I am proud of what I have achieved for the milestone:

- Manage the feature requirements
- Manage designers and developers
- Fine-tune UX
- Set the standard for the AI output
- Build the Keyword Research feature - Front End and Back End!
- And finally, implement the new Front End

**Result**

Since the introduction of Advance Mode, it has become the main choice of Kafkai users with 70% of app usage using Advance Mode.
