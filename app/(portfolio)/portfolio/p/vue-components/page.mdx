# Vue + Laravel Components Library

## Background

When I was working at Nazrol Tech Sdn Bhd (Software House) and involve in multiple projects, I notice there is alot of repetitive Front End components across projects.

Not only it was repetitive, but each project also has different way to build the feature, so it consume time and money to maintain each variation, eventhough they all do the same thing.

## Solution

So for new project that I was assigned as **Lead Developer**, I build this collection of Vue components to help speed Front End development and eliminate repetitive tasks.

You can watch the implementation here

  frameBorder={0}
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  allowFullScreen=""

## Result

The implementation was a success. We have use the components library for multiple projects, and managed to save alots of time and money. I just need to maintain the library and improve from time to time. Its battle harden.
