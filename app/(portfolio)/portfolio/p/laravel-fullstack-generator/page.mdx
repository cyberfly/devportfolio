# FullStackMe - Laravel Full Stack Generator

## Background

Our main tech stacks at Nazrol Tech Sdn Bhd is Laravel API with Angular SPA.

As a Full Stack developer working with both Front End and Backend, there is alot of things need to be properly setup to ensure the project can running smoothly.

## Standard Process

After database design, here is standard process to build a Laravel + Angular app

- Laravel Model and Relationship
- Laravel API Controller
- Laravel API Filter
- Laravel API Validation
- Laravel API Resource (transformer)
- Angular Service to consume API
- Typescript interface to API Response data
- Angular UI to interact with the data



## Solution

I build this generator that will output all the steps above in one click! Just connect to your database and customize the options if needed.

You can watch the implementation here

<iframe
  className="embed_video"
  width={560}
  height={315}
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXkDyMNRJNc?si=-NWdxBXLYyg8Q0Mr"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameBorder={0}
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  allowFullScreen=""
/>

## Result

It speed up our Laravel + Angular development by eliminating at least 30% of boilerplate code. Awesome!
