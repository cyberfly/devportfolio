# FullStackMe - Laravel Full Stack Generator

## Background

Our main tech stacks at Nazrol Tech Sdn Bhd are Laravel API with Angular SPA.

As a Full Stack developer working with both Front End and Backend, there are a lot of things that need to be properly set up to ensure the project can run smoothly.

## Standard Process

After the database design, here is the standard process to build a Laravel + Angular app.

- Laravel Model and Relationship
- Laravel API Controller
- Laravel API Filter
- Laravel API Validation
- Laravel API Resource (transformer)
- Angular Service to consume API
- Typescript interface to API Response data
- Angular UI to interact with the data

## Solution

I built this generator that will output all the steps above in one click! Just connect to your database and customize the options if needed.

You can watch the implementation here.

  width={560}
  height={315}

  title="YouTube video player"
  frameBorder={0}
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  allowFullScreen=""
/>

## Result

It speeds up our Laravel + Angular development by eliminating at least 30% of boilerplate code. Awesome!
