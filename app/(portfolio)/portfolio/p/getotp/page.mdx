# GetOTP - OTP as a service

For this project, I used HTMX and AlpineJS to implement reactive UI in the members area. 

One of the interesting features that I need to develop is Live Theme Customization.

With the help of HTMX, minimal Javascript is used to build these features.

I also write the documentation for GetOTP which can be found on the Docs page.

### WordPress plugin

I proposed that we build a WordPress plugin since this is where the biggest low-code audiences reside.

I then developed and successfully published the plugin that can be found here
