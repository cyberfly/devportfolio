# GetOTP - OTP as a service

GetOTP is a low-code solution to easily implement OTP functionality into your app.

Many projects at LaLoka Labs Co have OTP functionality, so we decided to package it as Software as a Service and make it available to our customers.

For this project, I used HTMX and AlpineJS to implement interactive UI in the members area.

One of the interesting features that I needed to develop is Live Theme Customization.

With the help of HTMX, minimal JavaScript is used to build these features.

I also wrote the documentation for GetOTP, which can be found on the Docs page.

### WordPress plugin

I proposed that we build a WordPress plugin since this is where the biggest low-code audiences reside.

I then developed and successfully published the plugin, which can be found here.

### Blog module

GetOTP blog is powered by WordPress Rest API. I then wrote the Python code to consume the Rest API and presented it as a blog page inside the GetOTP website.
